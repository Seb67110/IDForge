IDForge – Identity Management and Replication Platform
IDForge is a modular platform designed for identity management and synchronization across various systems. Built for heterogeneous environments, it provides a flexible approach without requiring a common key between systems.

Key Features:
Centralized Identity and Permission Management: IDForge enables centralized administration of users and roles while storing external system primary keys, avoiding the need for a shared unique identifier.
PowerShell-Based Replication Modules: IDForge uses PowerShell scripts for its replication modules, ensuring real-time synchronization of modified data across external systems.
Immediate execution: Replication occurs as soon as a data change is detected.
Conditional replication: Rules can be defined to trigger replication only when required—for example, when a specific option is checked.
Customizable replication: Easily extend modules to replicate additional fields or implement business-specific transformations.
Versioning and rollback: Each module version is tracked, allowing seamless rollback in case of issues after an update.
Advanced and Dynamic Form Creator: IDForge includes a Form Creator that enables custom form design with high flexibility.
Easily add new fields without complex structural modifications.
Define custom queries to:
Dynamically determine the content of a list-type field.
Customize the display based on context or user-specific conditions.
Implement advanced validation and specific processing, useful when an action goes beyond a simple database update.
A future enhancement will introduce AI-powered automation to create business rules easily, such as automatically formatting first names (e.g., capitalizing the first letter).
Versioned Database: Every modification in the structure of forms and entities is versioned, ensuring traceability and data consistency.
Secure and Robust API: All interactions are handled through a secure PHP API, structured into modules to ensure scalability and easy maintenance.
Technology Stack:
Backend: PHP with fine-grained access and permission management.
Frontend: Vue.js (preferred option but subject to change – to be defined).
Database: MySQL with stored procedures ensuring consistency and version management.
Replication Modules: PowerShell scripts executed in real time upon data changes.
IDForge is designed to provide agile and extensible identity management, enabling seamless integration with external systems while offering maximum flexibility for future enhancements.
